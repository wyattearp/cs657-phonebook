Topic 2 - A web application

Implement a phone book as a web application that does the following:
 * displays the phone book
 * lets the user add-to, delete-from or search the phone book database
 * allow maintaining of multiple phone books for different users
 * users will be required to create their accounts and will have to authenticate the access to their respective phone books using a system of username and password
 * displays the IP address of a visitor
 * e-mails the phone book as a file to the indicated address
 * make the GUI as elegant and demonstrative as possible
